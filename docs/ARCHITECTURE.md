# Codebase Analyzer Architecture

## Overview

The Codebase Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to analyze Python codebases, identify dependencies, and generate comprehensive reports using LLM-powered analysis. This document outlines the architecture, design decisions, and implementation details of the project.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Codebase Parser (`codebase_parser.py`)**
   - Purpose: Parse Python files and extract import/export relationships
   - Key Features:
     - AST-based parsing for accurate symbol extraction
     - Support for both static and dynamic imports
     - Circular dependency detection
   - Implementation Details:
     - Uses Python's `ast` module for parsing
     - Custom `ImportInfo` and `ExportInfo` dataclasses for structured data
     - Handles edge cases like relative imports and dynamic imports

2. **Dead Code Analyzer (`dead_code_analyzer.py`)**
   - Purpose: Identify unused code and symbols
   - Key Features:
     - AST-based analysis of symbol usage
     - Entry point detection
     - Cross-file symbol tracking
   - Implementation Details:
     - Tracks defined and used symbols across files
     - Identifies entry points (e.g., `if __name__ == "__main__"`)
     - Provides detailed dead code reports

3. **LLM Context Builder (`llm_context.py`)**
   - Purpose: Prepare codebase context for LLM analysis
   - Key Features:
     - Structured code context preparation
     - Dependency graph integration
     - Context chunking for large codebases
   - Implementation Details:
     - Uses `CodeContext` dataclass for structured data
     - Handles file path normalization
     - Supports context chunking for token limits

4. **Codebase Agent (`codebase_agent.py`)**
   - Purpose: Perform LLM-powered analysis
   - Key Features:
     - Structured prompt generation
     - Response parsing and validation
     - Error handling and retries
   - Implementation Details:
     - Uses LangChain for LLM interaction
     - Implements robust JSON extraction
     - Handles large responses through chunking

### Data Flow

1. **Initial Analysis**
   ```
   Codebase → Parser → Dependency Graph → Context Builder → LLM Context
   ```

2. **LLM Analysis**
   ```
   LLM Context → Codebase Agent → LLM → Analysis Results
   ```

3. **Output Generation**
   ```
   Analysis Results → JSON Files → Visualization
   ```

## Design Decisions and Trade-offs

### 1. AST-Based Parsing
- **Choice**: Using Python's `ast` module for parsing
- **Advantages**:
  - Accurate symbol extraction
  - Handles complex Python syntax
  - Reliable import/export detection
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Slower than regex-based parsing
  - Requires valid Python syntax
  - More complex implementation

### 2. LLM Integration
- **Choice**: Using LangChain with OpenAI's API
- **Advantages**:
  - Structured prompt handling
  - Built-in retry mechanisms
  - Token management
- **Trade-offs**:
  - API dependency
  - Cost considerations
  - Rate limiting

### 3. JSON-Based Output
- **Choice**: Using JSON for all output formats
- **Advantages**:
  - Machine-readable format
  - Easy integration with other tools
  - Structured data representation
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Larger file sizes
  - More complex parsing
  - Less human-readable than some formats

## Tool Choices

1. **Poetry**
   - Purpose: Dependency management
   - Reason: Modern Python packaging and dependency management
   - Benefits: Virtual environment management, dependency resolution

2. **pytest**
   - Purpose: Testing framework
   - Reason: Simple syntax, powerful features
   - Benefits: Fixtures, parameterized tests, good reporting

3. **NetworkX**
   - Purpose: Graph visualization
   - Reason: Powerful graph manipulation
   - Benefits: Multiple layout algorithms, easy to use

4. **LangChain**
   - Purpose: LLM integration
   - Reason: Structured LLM interactions
   - Benefits: Prompt templates, retry mechanisms, token management

## Implementation Challenges

1. **Circular Dependencies**
   - Solution: Detection and reporting
   - Implementation: Graph analysis with NetworkX
   - Impact: Better code quality insights

2. **Dynamic Imports**
   - Solution: Pattern matching and analysis
   - Implementation: AST visitor pattern
   - Impact: More accurate dependency tracking

3. **Large Codebases**
   - Solution: Context chunking
   - Implementation: Token-based splitting
   - Impact: Scalability to large projects

4. **LLM Response Parsing**
   - Solution: Robust JSON extraction
   - Implementation: Multiple parsing strategies
   - Impact: Reliable analysis results

## Future Improvements

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Parallel processing for large codebases
   - Caching of parsed results
   - Incremental analysis

2. **Enhanced Analysis**
   - Type inference
   - Code quality metrics
   - Security vulnerability detection

3. **Integration**
   - CI/CD pipeline integration
   - IDE plugins
   - Web interface

4. **LLM Enhancements**
   - Multiple LLM provider support
   - Custom fine-tuning
   - Response validation improvements
